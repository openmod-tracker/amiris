# In Short

Handles the imported/exported energy amounts in an electricity market region.
This occurs during and because of the market coupling.

# Details

During the market coupling demand bids are transferred from one electricity market region to another.
A transferred demand bid from a region A to a region B accounts as imported energy for region A and exported energy for region B.
Note: the transferred demand bids are usually parts of the original local demand bids.
