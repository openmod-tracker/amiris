# In Short
Handles the imported/exported energy amounts in an electricity market region. This occurs during and because of the market coupling.


# Details
During the market coupling demand bids are transferred from one electricity market region to another. A transferred demand bid from a region A to a region B accounts as imported energy for region A and exported energy for region B. Note: the transferred demand bids are usually parts of the original local demand bids.
