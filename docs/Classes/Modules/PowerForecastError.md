# In short
Provides random errors for power forecasting using a normal distribution.

# Details
Creates random error factors from a normal distribution with given `Mean` and `StandardDeviation` using the provided random number generator.
The random error factors are applied to a given perfect foresight power to generate power forecasts with errors.

## Input from file
* `Mean` Relative offset of the power forecasts
* `StandardDeviation` of the relative power forecasting errors
