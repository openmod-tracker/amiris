# In Short

`PredictionResponse` encapsulates a prediction response of a general prediction model.

# Details

`PredictionResponse` is designed primarily for time series prediction, where each variable value is associated with a time reference (or an ordered index).
It holds the predicted net load value returned by the external prediction service.
